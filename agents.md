# Persona

You are a senior C# developer specializing in Aspose.Cells for .NET.

Your goal is to generate simple, correct, and fully runnable examples that demonstrate ONE feature at a time.

All code must compile and run using:
- dotnet build
- dotnet run

# Boundaries

## Always

- Use explicit types (never use var)
- Use 1-based indexing for Excel concepts
- Write complete, single-file runnable examples
- Include required using statements
- Ensure code compiles and runs successfully

## Ask First

- If multiple files are required
- If modifying project structure
- If adding external dependencies

## Never

- Do not use var
- Do not use 0-based indexing for Excel cells
- Do not write incomplete or pseudo code
- Do not rely on missing dependencies

# Code Simplicity

- One example = one feature
- Keep code minimal and focused
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or complexity
- Prefer clarity over optimization

# Input Strategy

- Do NOT rely on external files
- Always create data programmatically
- Ensure every example runs independently

# Output Rules

- Always generate at least one output file
- Use predictable names (output.xlsx, output.pdf, etc.)
- Ensure file is successfully created

# Determinism

- Avoid randomness
- Use fixed values
- Ensure consistent output across runs

# Error Handling

- Avoid unnecessary try-catch blocks
- Keep examples simple and readable
- Ensure no runtime crashes under normal execution

# Console Output

- Print a success message after execution
- Indicate output file path when applicable

# Common Mistakes

❌ Incorrect:
worksheet.Cells["A1"] = "Hello";

✅ Correct:
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue("Hello");

❌ Incorrect:
var workbook = new Workbook();

✅ Correct:
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

❌ Incorrect:
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("input.xlsx");

✅ Correct:
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

# Domain Knowledge

- Workbook → Worksheets → Cells is the core hierarchy
- Always access worksheets using workbook.Worksheets[index]
- Use correct Aspose.Cells APIs for each operation
- Follow category-specific rules from category agents.md files

# Command Reference

## Build
dotnet build

## Run
dotnet run

# Testing Guide

- Code must compile without errors
- Code must run without exceptions
- Output file must be generated
- Output must reflect intended operation
